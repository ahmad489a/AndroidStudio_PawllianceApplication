# Android Studio Pawlliance Application

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an Android Application named "Pawlliance" that enables users to live-track their dog walks via GPS on a Google Maps Interface.
The application was developed in Android Studio (using Java) as a final personal project for my Computer Sciences studies at National College of Ireland. 

## Introction to Pawlliance
The idea for Pawlliance came, when I read an article about weekly excercise requirements of different dog breeds and therefore, wanted to get an idea, how much time and distance I am walking my Pomsky Neila each week.
Pawlliance enables user to sign up for an account and then live track their dog walks via their phone's GPS in a Google Maps interface. The objective of this application is also to connect dog owners with each other and set up dog walking dates or play dates for their puppies. 

## Current App Pages & Functionalities:
* App entry page with login and user signup path
* Pawlliance user registration pages with camera access and photo functionality
* Login Page for user login or option redirect to signup page
* Main cockpit page to start dog walking activity, Pawlliance friends, discover new friends and update profile
* Walking activity page that accesses a user's GPS to live track a dog walk and stores it in the dog walking history
* Dog walk summary page that displays date, time walked, distance walked, dog, a description and the map
* Pawlliance buddies page that displays current user friends in the application
* Connect page to find other Pawlliance users in the area (tbc.)
* Update profile page
